Overview: Developed a comprehensive Hospital Management System with distinct user interfaces for patients and
administrators. The system provides role-based access control, ensuring that different users (patients and
admins) have access to the appropriate functionalities.
• Role-Based Authentication: Configured secure login mechanisms for both patients and administrators using
JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
• Data Security: Applied encryption for sensitive data such as passwords (e.g., using bcrypt) and ensured
secure data transmission using HTTPS.
• Image and File Management: Integrated Cloudinary for handling all image and file uploads. This
includes storing, processing, and delivering images and files across the application.
